# Portland (PDX) Digital Corps

**PDX Digital Corps** is a short-term, volunteer-led civic tech initiative helping nonprofits and mission-driven organizations across the Portland metro area solve small, high-impact digital challenges.

We match teams of experienced designers, developers, and product professionals with local organizations to scope, build, and deliver digital improvements—fast. Whether it’s fixing a website, improving a form, or building a lightweight tool, we focus on work that’s meaningful, scoped, and deliverable within a short sprint.

## ✳️ What We Do

- Redesign outdated nonprofit websites  
- Improve digital forms and online application workflows  
- Fix accessibility or usability issues  
- Build lightweight tools (maps, dashboards, automations)  
- Conduct research or discovery for future digital work  
- Scope and document problems so future work is clearer  

We use agile workflows, rapid prototyping, and proven delivery methods inspired by teams like [18F](https://18f.gsa.gov) and the [U.S. Digital Service](https://usds.gov)—applied to local needs.

## 🎯 Who It's For

### 🧰 Volunteers  
Designers, developers, product folks, and technologists interested in public-interest work, working on real teams, building real things.

Whether you’re between roles, looking to sharpen your skills, or want to give back, this is a structured way to contribute meaningfully to your community.

### 🏛 Nonprofits & Public Sector Orgs  
If you're a community org or government entity with a digital problem you don’t know how to fix—or don’t have the capacity to tackle alone—we might be able to help.

We're prioritizing Portland-area orgs, but we’ll consider others across Oregon and SW Washington when remote collaboration makes sense.

## 🌀 How It Works

1. **Submit a request.** Tell us what’s going on.  
2. **We scope the project.** Sometimes your problem isn't what you think it is.  
3. **We assemble a team.** Skilled volunteers matched to your need.  
4. **We deliver.** A usable, well-scoped digital solution—no strings, no fees.

## 🚫 What We *Don't* Do

- General tech support or troubleshooting  
- Print design, copywriting, or branding  
- Long-term maintenance of tools we build  
- Work for for-profit companies (unless clearly public benefit)

## 📦 Repositories

Each project will have its own repo within this GitHub org for documentation, code, and assets. Examples:

- `website-redesign-org-name`  
- `form-accessibility-audit`  
- `mapping-local-resources`  
- `intake-form-improvements`

# Portland Digital Corps

**Portland Digital Corps** is a short-term, volunteer-led civic tech initiative helping nonprofits and mission-driven organizations across the Portland metro area solve small, high-impact digital challenges.

We match teams of experienced designers, developers, and product professionals with local organizations to scope, build, and deliver digital improvements—fast. Whether it’s fixing a website, improving a form, or building a lightweight tool, we focus on work that’s meaningful, scoped, and deliverable in an 8-week sprint.

## ✳️ What We Do

- Redesign outdated nonprofit websites
- Improve digital forms and online application workflows
- Fix accessibility or usability issues
- Build lightweight tools (maps, dashboards, automations)
- Conduct research or discovery for future digital work
- Scope and document problems so future work is clearer

We use agile workflows, rapid prototyping, and proven delivery methods inspired by teams like 18F and the U.S. Digital Service—applied to local needs.

## 🎯 Who It's For

### 🧰 Volunteers
Designers, developers, product folks, and technologists interested in public-interest work, working on real teams, building real things.

Whether you’re between roles, looking to sharpen your skills, or want to give back, this is a structured way to contribute meaningfully in just 8 weeks.

### 🏢 Nonprofits & Public Sector Orgs
If you're a community org or government entity with a digital problem you don't know how to fix—or don’t have the capacity to tackle alone—we might be able to help.

We're prioritizing Portland-area orgs, but will consider others across Oregon and SW Washington on a case-by-case basis.

## 🌀 How It Works

1. **Org submits a request.** We scope what’s needed.
2. **Team assembles.** We match volunteers to your project.
3. **8-week sprint.** We work collaboratively, then hand off.
4. **You own the results.** No strings, no fees. Just results.

## 🚫 What We *Don't* Do

- General tech support or troubleshooting
- Print design, copywriting, or branding
- Long-term maintenance of tools we build
- Work for for-profit companies (unless clearly public benefit)

## 📦 Repositories

Each project will have its own repo within this GitHub org for documentation, code, and assets. Example repos might include:

- `website-redesign-org-name`
- `pdx-corps-form-accessibility`
- `tool-viz-houseless-support`
- `project-intake-form`
